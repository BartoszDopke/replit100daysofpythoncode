# Day 2 Challenge

Write code that does the following:
- Asks for the user's name, favorite food, favorite music and where they live (or you can create other questions!)
- Store all of the answers in different variables.
- Print out a full sentence that includes the user's favorite things.
- Give them a positive affirmation at the end - tell them they rock at doing something!
